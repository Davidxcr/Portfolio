This is the Github Repository for my personal Portfolio Website.

I employed a clean, responsive, and minimal design throughout the website, making use of only 4 colors, Orange, Blue, Black, and Grey.
I have also included links to some small projects I have worked on while learning Web Development and Python.
I try to use this portfolio website as my test subject for all new technologies that I learn and pick-up.

Feel free to use this code as you wish, let me see what you come up with.
I'll continue to make changes to this website as I learn more and progress.
