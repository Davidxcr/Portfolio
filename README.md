This is the Github Repo for my Portfolio Website.

I employed a clean and minimal design throughout the website, making use of only 4 colors, Orange, Blue, Black, and Grey.
I have also included links to some small projects i have worked on while learning Web Development and Python.

Feel free to use this code as you wish, let me see what you come up with.
